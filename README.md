# AI Resume Builder

A premium, deterministic, ATS-aware resume builder built with React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS. It features live preview, multi-template layouts, accent color themes, structured editing with persistence, export options, inline guidance, ATS scoring, and a final Proof/Submission workflow.


## Key Features

- Structured sections: Personal, Summary, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills
- Tag-style inputs for grouped Skills and Project Tech Stack
- Inline guidance for Experience/Project bullets (action verb and impact hints)
- Deterministic ATS Scoring (0–100) with circular indicator and improvement suggestions
- Export options: Download PDF (print) and Copy Resume as Text
- Clean Print styling (white background, spacing, page-break handling)
- LocalStorage persistence for all inputs and settings
- Proof + Submission page with URL validation and shipped logic


## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS


## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Run the development server

   npm run dev

3. Open the app

   - The dev server will print the local URL (typically http://localhost:5173)


## Scripts

- npm run dev — start Vite dev server
- npm run build — production build
- npm run preview — preview production build locally

## Core Flows

### 1) Resume Building
- Enter Personal Information, Summary, Education, Experience, Projects, and Links.
- Skills are grouped into three categories with tag-style inputs: Technical, Soft, Tools & Technologies.
- For Experience and Projects, inline guidance encourages:
  - Starting bullets with strong action verbs (Built, Led, Designed, Implemented, Improved, Created, Optimized, Automated)
  - Adding measurable impact/metrics (numbers, %, k/m/x)
- All data persists automatically to localStorage (key: resumeBuilderData).


### 2) Templates and Color Themes
- Choose among three templates with 120px thumbnails:
  - Classic: single-column with serif headings and rules
  - Modern: two-column layout with a colored left sidebar for contact + skills
  - Minimal: single-column with generous whitespace and sans-serif
- Pick an accent color: Teal (default), Navy, Burgundy, Forest, Charcoal.
- Selections persist to localStorage: resumeTemplate and resumeAccent.


### 3) Live Preview and ATS Score
- Preview updates as you type (the preview polls localStorage for changes every ~800ms).
- ATS Score (0–100) is deterministic (no AI) and calculates:
  - +10 name provided
  - +10 email provided
  - +10 summary > 50 chars
  - +15 at least 1 experience entry with bullets
  - +10 at least 1 education entry
  - +10 at least 5 skills
  - +10 at least 1 project
  - +5 phone provided
  - +5 LinkedIn provided
  - +5 GitHub provided
  - +10 summary contains action verbs (Built, Developed, Designed, Implemented, Led, Improved, Created, Optimized, Automated)
- Circular progress indicator with label:
  - 0–40: Red “Needs Work”
  - 41–70: Amber “Getting There”
  - 71–100: Green “Strong Resume”
- Improvement suggestions list items that would increase the score.


### 4) Export Options
- Download PDF (via window.print()) — prints only the resume; UI/navigation hidden in print.
- Copy Resume as Text — produces a clean text version with ordered sections:
  - Name, Contact, Summary, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Links


### 5) Print Styling
- White background only; clean margins; consistent spacing.
- Page-break hints applied to avoid splitting sections awkwardly.


### 6) Proof + Submission (/rb/proof)
- Step Completion Overview — displays 8 steps with PASS/MISSING using RB_STEPS and STORAGE_PREFIX.
- Final Submission Links — three fields with URL validation (http/https):
  - Lovable Project Link
  - GitHub Repository
  - Live Deployment URL
- Stored under localStorage key: rb_final_submission.
- Final Submission export button copies:

  ------------------------------------------
  AI Resume Builder — Final Submission

  Lovable Project: {link}
  GitHub Repository: {link}
  Live Deployment: {link}

  Core Capabilities:
  - Structured resume builder
  - Deterministic ATS scoring
  - Template switching
  - PDF export with clean formatting
  - Persistence + validation checklist
  ------------------------------------------

- Shipped Status Rule (badge shows Shipped only if all of the following are true):
  - All 8 steps marked completed
  - All 10 checklist tests passed (localStorage key rb_checklist_results: { total: 10, passed: 10 })
  - All 3 proof links are valid URLs
- When shipped: “Project 3 Shipped Successfully.”


## Data Persistence (localStorage Keys)

- resumeBuilderData — Main resume content (personal info, summary, education, experience, projects, skills, links)
- resumeTemplate — Selected template (Classic | Modern | Minimal)
- resumeAccent — Selected color accent (HSL string)
- rb_final_submission — Proof links object { lovable, github, deploy }
- rb_checklist_results — Checklist results { total: number, passed: number } (expected { total:10, passed:10 } to ship)
- rb_step_{id}_artifact — Step artifact strings used to mark steps as PASS


## Validation and Guidance

- URL validation: Simple http/https format checks for proof links.
- Action-verb and measurable impact guidance for Experience/Projects.
- Summary length and action-verb detection influence ATS score.


## Verification Checklist

- All form sections save to localStorage
- Live preview updates in real-time
- Template switching preserves data
- Color theme persists after refresh
- ATS score calculates correctly and updates live
- Export buttons work (copy/download)
- Empty states handled gracefully
- Mobile-responsive layout works
- No console errors on any page
- /rb/proof shipped status requires: 8 steps + 10 checks + 3 valid links


## Contributing

- Keep the premium, minimal aesthetic.
- Do not change routes or remove existing features.
- Avoid heavy libraries for new features.
- Ensure new additions are deterministic and maintain score stability.
