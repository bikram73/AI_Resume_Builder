step 3:prompt 3
Upgrade AI Resume Builder with autosave + ATS scoring v1 (deterministic).

NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Do NOT change routes.
- Keep premium design.
- Persist resume data in localStorage.

1) Auto-save data
- Save all form fields and sections in localStorage under:
  resumeBuilderData
- On load, prefill form + preview from stored data.

2) Live Preview must be real
- Preview panel should render actual content from form.
- Use clean typography.
- Use section headers:
  Summary, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Links
- Empty states:
  If section is empty, don't show it in preview.

3) ATS Score v1 (0–100)
Compute score deterministically:
+15 if summary length is 40–120 words
+10 if at least 2 projects
+10 if at least 1 experience entry
+10 if skills list has ≥ 8 items
+10 if GitHub or LinkedIn link exists
+15 if any experience/project bullet contains a number (%, X, k, etc.)
+10 if education section has complete fields
Cap at 100.

Show:
- Score meter (calm, premium)
- Label: "ATS Readiness Score"

4) Suggestions (3 max)
Based on what's missing:
Examples:
- "Add at least 2 projects."
- "Add measurable impact (numbers) in bullets."
- "Add more skills (target 8+)."
- "Write a stronger summary (40–120 words)."
Show suggestions under score.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:

On /builder and /preview:
Add 3 template options:
- Classic
- Modern
- Minimal

Switching templates must:
- Change layout styling only
- NOT change content or logic
- Keep clean black/white resume style

2) Enforce Bullet Structure Guidance
In Experience and Projects sections:
For each bullet:
- If bullet does NOT start with an action verb (simple check for common verbs: Built, Developed, Designed, Implemented, Led, Improved, Created, Optimized, Automated):
   Show subtle inline suggestion:
   "Start with a strong action verb."
- If bullet has no numeric indicator (%, X, k, numbers):
   Show suggestion:
   "Add measurable impact (numbers)."

Do NOT block user input.
Only guide.

3) Improvement Panel
Under ATS Score:
Add section:
"Top 3 Improvements"
Based on logic:
- If <2 projects → suggest adding project.
- If no numbers → suggest measurable impact.
- If summary <40 words → suggest expanding.
- If skills <8 → suggest expanding.
- If no experience → suggest adding internship/project work.

4) Maintain Score Stability
Score logic from previous step must remain intact.
Template switching must NOT affect score.

5) Persist Template Choice
Store selected template in localStorage.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm templates switch layout correctly.

- Do NOT remove features.
- Keep premium black/white resume styling.
- Do NOT introduce heavy libraries.

1) Export Options
Add on /preview:
- Button: "Print / Save as PDF"
  → Use browser print styling.

  → Remove navigation and UI elements in print mode.

- Button: "Copy Resume as Text"
  → Generate clean plain-text version:
     Name
     Contact
     Summary
     Education
     Experience
     Projects
     Skills
     Links
  → Copy to clipboard.

2) Print Styling Rules
In print mode:
- White background only.
- No colored accents.
- Clean margins.
- Consistent spacing.
- No cut-off sections.
- Page break rules:
   Avoid splitting project bullets across pages if possible.

3) Validation Hardening
Before export:
If missing:

- At least one project or experience
Show calm warning:
"Your resume may look incomplete."
Do NOT block export.
Only warn.

4) Layout Precision
- Ensure no section overlaps.
- Ensure consistent spacing scale.
- Ensure no text overflow.

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Confirm PDF print styling works.
- Confirm plain-text copy works.
- Provide verification steps.



step 6:prompt 6

Build the Skills and Projects accordion sections.

Skills Section:
- Three skill categories displayed as labeled groups: "Technical Skills", "Soft Skills", "Tools & Technologies"
- Each category has a tag-style input: type a skill name and press Enter to add it as a pill/chip. Each chip has an X button to remove.
- A "✨ Suggest Skills" button. On click, show loading for 1 second, then add these skills:
  - Technical: "TypeScript", "React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL", "GraphQL"
  - Soft Skills: "Team Leadership", "Problem Solving"
  - Tools: "Git", "Docker", "AWS"
- Show skill count per category: "Technical Skills (5)"

Projects Section:
- "Add Project" button
- Each project entry: Project Title (text input), Description (textarea, max 200 chars with counter), Tech Stack (tag input like skills), Live URL (optional text input), GitHub URL (optional text input)
- Collapsible entries with project title as header
- Delete button per entry

Update the live preview: Show skills as grouped pill badges. Show projects as cards with title, description, tech stack pills, and link icons.

Save to localStorage on every change.



step 7:prompt 7

Add a template selection system and color customization to the resume builder.

1. Template Picker — show 3 visual template thumbnails at the top of the preview panel (above the A4 preview):
   - "Classic" — Traditional single-column layout, serif heading font, horizontal rules between sections
   - "Modern" — Two-column layout with a colored left sidebar containing contact info and skills, main content on the right
   - "Minimal" — Clean single-column, no borders or rules, generous whitespace, sans-serif throughout

2. Each thumbnail is a small (120px wide) preview card showing the layout sketch. Active template has a blue border and checkmark.

3. Switching templates re-renders the resume preview with the same data but different layout and typography.

4. Color Theme Picker — show 5 color circles below the template picker:
   - Teal (default): hsl(168, 60%, 40%)
   - Navy: hsl(220, 60%, 35%)
   - Burgundy: hsl(345, 60%, 35%)
   - Forest: hsl(150, 50%, 30%)
   - Charcoal: hsl(0, 0%, 25%)

   Clicking a color updates the accent color used in headings, borders, and sidebar background across all templates.

5. Store the selected template and color in localStorage.

6. Update the "Download PDF" button to show a toast: "PDF export ready! Check your downloads." (actual PDF generation not needed).



step 8:prompt 8

Add ATS Resume Scoring to the resume builder and test all features.

1) ATS Score Calculator (deterministic, no AI):

Score starts at 0, max 100.

Rules:
+10 if name provided
+10 if email provided
+10 if summary > 50 chars
+15 if at least 1 experience entry with bullets
+10 if at least 1 education entry
+10 if at least 5 skills added
+10 if at least 1 project added
+5 if phone provided
+5 if LinkedIn provided
+5 if GitHub provided
+10 if summary contains action verbs (built, led, designed, improved, etc.)

2) Display score as circular progress on /preview:
- 0-40: Red "Needs Work"
- 41-70: Amber "Getting There"
- 71-100: Green "Strong Resume"

3) Show improvement suggestions below score:
- List missing items that would increase score
- Example: "Add a professional summary (+10 points)"

4) Score must update live as user edits.

5) Test checklist (10 items):
□ All form sections save to localStorage
□ Live preview updates in real-time
□ Template switching preserves data
□ Color theme persists after refresh
□ ATS score calculates correctly
□ Score updates live on edit
□ Export buttons work (copy/download)
□ Empty states handled gracefully
□ Mobile responsive layout works
□ No console errors on any page
